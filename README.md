- Clone the project using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mhbabu/project-management

   ````bash
   composer install
- then copy all the code example.env file and paste it .env file and set up your database connection
- then run
   ````bash
   npm install
- then run
   ````bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
- then run
   ````bash
   php artisan serve
- then run
   ````bash
   npm run dev

   ````bash
   php artisan reverb:start
